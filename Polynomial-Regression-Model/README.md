<h1>Polynomial Regression Model Comparison</h1>
<p>This project demonstrates the use of polynomial regression with Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques to analyze and predict non-linear data. The main objective is to understand how these regularization methods affect the model's ability to capture underlying trends in the data.</p>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset is synthetically generated using NumPy, consisting of 1000 samples with non-linear relationships. The data is created with a quadratic dependency injected with random noise to simulate real-world data complexity.</p>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Generate non-linear data using a polynomial equation and add random noise.</li>
  <li>Transform the data using polynomial features up to the fourth degree.</li>
  <li>Train a Lasso regularized linear regression model.</li>
  <li>Train a Ridge regularized linear regression model.</li>
  <li>Analyze and compare the coefficients and performance of both models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>This project utilizes the following technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python: The primary programming language.</li>
  <li>NumPy: For data generation and manipulations.</li>
  <li>scikit-learn: For implementing polynomial feature transformation and regression models.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The results include the coefficients predicted by both Lasso and Ridge regression models. These coefficients highlight how each regularization technique impacts the inclusion of features of different degrees:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lasso tends to zero out coefficients of less important features to reduce complexity.</li>
  <li>Ridge adjusts the coefficients smoothly, thus avoiding overfitting by distributing the penalty among all coefficients.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This analysis shows that while Lasso can simplify models by eliminating coefficients, Ridge regularization is more suited for cases where all features have a potential contribution, albeit minor, thus preserving the complexity of the model. Further studies could explore the impact of different alpha values and feature scaling.</p>
