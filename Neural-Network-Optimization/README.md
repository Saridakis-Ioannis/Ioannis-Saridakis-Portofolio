<h1>Neural Network Model Optimization</h1>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The project utilizes a synthetic dataset designed to test the performance of neural network models. The dataset includes features simulating real-world scenarios, making it ideal for training and testing deep learning models.</p>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data Preprocessing: Standardization of features to ensure model accuracy.</li>
  <li>Model Building: Constructed models with varying hidden layer configurations (50 and 200 nodes).</li>
  <li>Model Training: Applied regularization techniques to prevent overfitting, training stopped after optimal epochs based on validation loss.</li>
  <li>Evaluation: Comparison of model performance with and without regularization, using accuracy and loss metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<p>This project is implemented using Python with TensorFlow and Keras for building and training neural network models. Jupyter Notebook is used for interactive development and visualization.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The enhanced model with 200 nodes per layer and dropout regularization significantly outperformed the basic model, demonstrating the effectiveness of using more complex architectures and regularization to improve generalization on unseen data.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project illustrates the importance of model configuration and regularization in neural networks. Future work could explore alternative architectures and further tuning of the regularization parameters to maximize model performance.</p>
