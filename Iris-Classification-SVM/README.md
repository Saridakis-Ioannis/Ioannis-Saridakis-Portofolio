<h1>Machine Learning with SVM: Iris Classification</h1>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The project uses the Iris dataset from the sklearn datasets module, focusing on the features 'sepal length' and 'sepal width' and classifying between 'Iris Setosa' and 'Iris Virginica'.</p>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<p>The workflow includes loading the data, visualizing it, training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with different regularization parameters, and plotting decision boundaries to compare performance.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>NumPy</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>scikit-learn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Models trained with different values of 'C' showed how regularization impacts the decision boundaries between classes. The visualizations clearly illustrate the effect of the regularization parameter on classifier performance.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The analysis demonstrates that a lower value of 'C' leads to better generalization in distinguishing between the two Iris flower types. A higher 'C' value, while fitting the training data more closely, may lead to overfitting.</p>
