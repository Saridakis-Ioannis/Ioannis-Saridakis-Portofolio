<h1>Stacking Classifier Project on MNIST Dataset</h1>

<h1>Dataset</h1>
<p>The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images used commonly for training various image processing systems. The dataset is ideal for training classification algorithms and testing their performance.</p>

<h1>Project Workflow</h1>
<p>The workflow involves training multiple classifiers including Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra-Trees, LinearSVC, and Logistic Regression. These classifiers are then combined into a stacking classifier to improve prediction accuracy.</p>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Scikit-Learn</li>
    <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>Results include the accuracy of individual classifiers as well as the stacking classifier, demonstrating the effectiveness of classifier ensembles over single models.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This project showcases the benefits of using stacking classifiers for complex datasets like MNIST, highlighting improvements in model accuracy and robustness.</p>

<h1>How to Run</h1>
<p>To run this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Ensure Python and the necessary libraries (scikit-learn, Jupyter) are installed. Open the notebook in Jupyter and execute the cells sequentially.</p>
