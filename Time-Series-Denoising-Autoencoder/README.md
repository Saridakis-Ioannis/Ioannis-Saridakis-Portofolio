<h1>Time Series Denoising using Autoencoders</h1>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset used in this project consists of synthetic time series data generated with added noise to simulate real-world noisy signals. The goal is to clean the noisy data using an autoencoder model.</p>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data Generation: Synthetic time series data is generated with controlled noise levels.</li>
  <li>Model Building: An autoencoder model is designed to learn to denoise the data.</li>
  <li>Training: The model is trained using the noisy datasets.</li>
  <li>Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to remove noise and reconstruct the original signals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>TensorFlow/Keras</li>
  <li>Matplotlib for visualization</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The autoencoder model demonstrated varying performance across different configurations of the latent space. A latent space size of 4 nodes proved to be optimal for denoising the time series data, effectively removing the noise while retaining the essential characteristics of the original signal.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The autoencoder model with a 4-node latent space effectively denoises the time series data, suggesting that it can be adapted for similar tasks in noise reduction applications. The project highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate size of the latent space to balance noise removal and data fidelity.</p>
