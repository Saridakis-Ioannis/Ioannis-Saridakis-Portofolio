<h1>Convolutional Neural Network for MNIST Digit Classification</h1>

<h1>Dataset</h1>
<p>This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, split into training, validation, and test sets for developing a model that accurately classifies digits from 0 to 9.</p>

<h1>Project Workflow</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Load MNIST data, split into training, validation, and test sets, and normalize the values.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Building:</strong> Construct and compile convolutional neural network models with varying configurations of kernels/filters (16, 32, 64 and 32, 64, 128).</li>
  <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Train models using the training data and validate using the validation data.</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Evaluate the final model using the test dataset to assess performance.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>TensorFlow and Keras for model construction and training</li>
