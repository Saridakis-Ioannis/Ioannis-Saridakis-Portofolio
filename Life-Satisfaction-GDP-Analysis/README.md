<h1>Polynomial Regression Analysis for Life Satisfaction Prediction</h1>

<h1>Dataset</h1>
<p>The dataset used in this project includes GDP and Life Satisfaction Index (LSI) data for various countries. It is designed to analyze the correlation between a nation's economic output and the well-being of its citizens.</p>

<h1>Project Workflow</h1>
<p>The project workflow includes:
<ul>
    <li>Loading and cleaning the dataset.</li>
    <li>Exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution.</li>
    <li>Application of polynomial regression to predict life satisfaction based on GDP.</li>
    <li>Analysis of overfitting by experimenting with various polynomial degrees.</li>
    <li>Final model selection based on performance metrics.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>
<p>This project utilizes the following technologies:
<ul>
    <li>Python: For data manipulation and machine learning.</li>
    <li>Jupyter Notebook: As an interactive computational environment.</li>
    <li>NumPy and pandas: For data handling.</li>
    <li>Scikit-learn: For implementing polynomial regression and model evaluation.</li>
    <li>Matplotlib: For data visualization.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Results</h1>
<p>The analysis revealed that a polynomial of degree 8 overfits the data with a poor generalization to new GDP values. In contrast, a more moderate polynomial degree provides a better balance between bias and variance, leading to more reliable predictions of life satisfaction based on GDP.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This project highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate polynomial degree in regression analysis to avoid overfitting. By selecting a suitable model, we can achieve more accurate and generalizable predictions of life satisfaction from economic indicators such as GDP.</p>
